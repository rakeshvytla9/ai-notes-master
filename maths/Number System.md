## 🌳 **2. Classification of Numbers**

All numbers can be broadly classified into two categories:

### **A. Real Numbers ($R$)**
*   Numbers that exist on the number line (from $-\infty$ to $+\infty$).
*   Includes integers, fractions, and decimals.

### **B. Imaginary Numbers**
*   Square root of a negative number.
*   **Symbol:** $i$ (iota), where $i = \sqrt{-1}$ or $i^2 = -1$.
*   **Examples:** $\sqrt{-3}, \sqrt{-5}$.

> **Complex Numbers:** Combination of Real and Imaginary numbers (Form: $a + ib$). Example: $2 + 3i$.

## 🔢 **3. Breakdown of Real Numbers**

Real numbers are further divided into **Rational** and **Irrational** numbers.

### **I. Rational Numbers**
A number is rational if it satisfies the following conditions:
1.  Can be written in the form $\frac{p}{q}$ (Numerator/Denominator).
2.  $q \neq 0$ (Denominator is not zero).
3.  $p$ and $q$ both must be **Integers**.

> **Note on Co-primes:** You are correct that for a rational number to be in its **standard (or simplest) form**, $p$ and $q$ must be **co-prime** (HCF is 1). However, the general definition simply requires them to be integers. For example, $\frac{2}{4}$ is a rational number, even though 2 and 4 are not co-prime. Its standard form is $\frac{1}{2}$.

**Examples:**
*   $\frac{2}{7}$ ✅
*   $5 = \frac{5}{1}$ ✅
*   $1.7 = \frac{17}{10}$ ✅
*   $\sqrt{36} = 6 = \frac{6}{1}$ ✅ (Perfect square roots are rational)
*   **0** ✅ (Can be written as $\frac{0}{1}$; $p=0, q=1$). **Zero is a Rational Number.**
*   $22/7$ ✅ (It satisfies the $p/q$ form).

### **II. Irrational Numbers**
Numbers that cannot be written in the form of $\frac{p}{q}$ where $p$ and $q$ are integers. Typically, these involve roots of non-perfect squares.

**Examples:**
*   $\sqrt{5}$ ❌ (Value is not an integer)
*   $\frac{\sqrt{25}}{\sqrt{26}} = \frac{5}{\sqrt{26}}$ ❌ ($\sqrt{26}$ is not an integer)
*   $\pi$ (Pi) ❌

### ⚡ **Important Concept: $\pi$ vs $\frac{22}{7}$**
| **Number** | **Type** | **Reason** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **$\frac{22}{7}$** | **Rational** | It satisfies the $p/q$ form with integers. It is an *approximate* value of Pi. |
| **$\pi$ (Pi)** | **Irrational** | Its exact value is non-terminating and non-recurring. |

*   **Definition of $\pi$:** Ratio of Circumference to Diameter ($\frac{C}{d}$).
*   **Approximate value:** $3.14$ (This specific decimal $3.14$ is rational, but the symbol $\pi$ represents the exact irrational value).

---

## 📉 **4. Classification of Decimals**

Decimals are classified based on their ending behavior.

### **A. Terminating Decimal**
*   The division ends (terminates) completely.
*   **Status:** Always **Rational Numbers**.
*   **Examples:** $0.5, 0.25, 0.6$

### **B. Non-Terminating Decimal**
The division never ends. These are further split into two types:

1.  **Recurring / Repeating:**
    *   Digits repeat in a pattern.
    *   Can be written using a bar (e.g., $0.\bar{3}$).
    *   **Status:** **Rational Numbers**.
    *   **Example:** $0.3333...$

2.  **Non-Recurring / Non-Repeating:**
    *   Digits do not repeat and do not end.
    *   **Status:** **Irrational Numbers**.
    *   **Example:** $0.14379815...$ (Like the value of $\pi$ or $\sqrt{2}$).

---

## 🔢 **5. Integers**
Range: $-\infty$ to $+\infty$.

Integers are classified as:
1.  **Positive Integers:** $\{1, 2, 3, 4, \dots \infty\}$
    *   Also known as **Natural Numbers**.
2.  **Negative Integers:** $\{-\infty, \dots -3, -2, -1\}$
    *   *Note:* In negative numbers, the smaller the digit, the larger the actual value.
3.  **Zero (0):**
    *   Zero is neither positive nor negative. It is a neutral Integer.

### **Whole Numbers**
*   If we add **0** to the set of Natural Numbers, they become Whole Numbers.
*   **Range:** $\{0, 1, 2, 3, \dots \infty\}$

---

## ⚖️ **6. Even and Odd Numbers**

*   **Even Numbers:** Numbers exactly divisible by 2.
    *   Unit digits: $0, 2, 4, 6, 8$.
    *   Smallest positive even number: **2**. (Note: If range isn't specified, 0, -2, -4 are also even integers).
*   **Odd Numbers:** Numbers not divisible by 2.
    *   Smallest positive odd number: **1**.

---

## 🌟 **7. Prime Numbers**

**Definition:** A number that has **exactly two factors**:
1.  1
2.  The number itself.

**Key Points:**
*   **1** is **NOT** a prime number (It has only one factor: 1).
*   **2** is the **Smallest Prime Number**.
*   **2** is the **only Even Prime Number**.
*   Examples: $2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, \dots$

## 🔢 **1. Co-Prime Numbers (Sah-Abhajya Sankhya)**

*   **Definition:** A pair of numbers is called Co-Prime if their **Highest Common Factor (HCF) is 1**.
*   **Key Concept:** They do **not** necessarily need to be prime numbers themselves. The only requirement is that they have no common factor other than 1.

**Examples:**
*   **(2, 4):** Not Co-Prime (HCF is 2).
*   **(3, 4):** ✅ **Co-Prime** (HCF is 1). Note that 4 is not a prime number.
*   **(5, 7):** ✅ **Co-Prime** (HCF is 1).
*   **(17, 23):** ✅ **Co-Prime** (HCF is 1).

## ♊ **2. Twin Prime Numbers (Judwa Abhajya Sankhya)**

*   **Definition:** A pair of **prime numbers** that have a **difference of 2**.
*   **Condition:** Both numbers in the pair **MUST** be prime.

**List of Twin Primes between 1 and 100 (Total 8 Pairs):**
1.  (3, 5)
2.  (5, 7)
3.  (11, 13)
4.  (17, 19)
5.  (29, 31)
6.  (41, 43)
7.  (59, 61)
8.  (71, 73)

> **Note:** Pairs like (87, 89) are NOT twin primes because 87 is not a prime number (divisible by 3 and 29).

---

## 🧱 **3. Composite Numbers (Bhajya/Sanyukt Sankhya)**

*   **Definition:** Numbers that have **more than 2 factors**.
*   **Meaning:** The number is divisible by 1, itself, and at least one other number.

**Key Facts:**
*   **1** is neither Prime nor Composite.
*   **Smallest Composite Number:** **4** (Factors: 1, 2, 4).
*   **Smallest Odd Composite Number:** **9** (Factors: 1, 3, 9).

---

## 🌟 **4. Perfect Numbers (Uttam Sankhya)**

*   **Definition:** A number is a Perfect Number if the **sum of all its factors (excluding the number itself)** is equal to the number.

**Examples:**
*   **6:** Factors are 1, 2, 3, 6.
    *   Sum (excluding 6): $1 + 2 + 3 = 6$. ✅ **Perfect Number**.
*   **28:** Factors are 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28.
    *   Sum (excluding 28): $1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28$. ✅ **Perfect Number**.
*   **Other Examples:** 496, 8128.

> **Observation:** Perfect numbers generally end with the digit **6** or **8**.

## 🧮 **5. Mathematical Operations & Properties**

### **A. Operations on Odd and Even Numbers**

| Operation | Result | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Addition (+)** | | |
| Odd + Odd | **Even** | $3 + 5 = 8$ |
| Odd + Even | **Odd** | $3 + 4 = 7$ |
| Even + Even | **Even** | $4 + 6 = 10$ |
| **Multiplication (×)** | | |
| Odd × Odd | **Odd** | $3 \times 5 = 15$ |
| Odd × Even | **Even** | $7 \times 4 = 28$ |
| Even × Even | **Even** | $4 \times 6 = 24$ |

### **B. Operations on Rational and Irrational Numbers**

**1. Addition (+):**
*   **Rational + Rational = Rational**
    *   Example: $2/5 + 3/5 = 1$
*   **Rational + Irrational = Irrational**
    *   Example: $2 + \sqrt{3}$
*   **Irrational + Irrational = Rational OR Irrational**
    *   *Result is Irrational:* $\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{7}$
    *   *Result is Rational:* $(3 + \sqrt{2}) + (3 - \sqrt{2}) = 6$

**2. Multiplication (×):**
*   **Rational × Rational = Rational**
*   **Rational × Irrational = Rational OR Irrational**
    *   If Rational number is **0**: $0 \times \sqrt{5} = 0$ (**Rational**)
    *   If Rational number is **non-zero**: $2 \times \sqrt{3} = 2\sqrt{3}$ (**Irrational**)
*   **Irrational × Irrational = Rational OR Irrational**
    *   *Result is Irrational:* $\sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{7} = \sqrt{21}$
    *   *Result is Rational:* $\sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{3} = 3$

## 📉 **6. Concept of Nth Root**

For a number in the form $\sqrt[m]{n}$ or $(n)^{1/m}$:
*   **Rational:** It is a rational number ONLY if $n$ can be written as the power of an integer equal to the root (i.e., $n = x^m$).
    *   Example: $\sqrt[3]{27} = (3^3)^{1/3} = 3$ (Rational).
*   **Irrational:** It is irrational unless $n$ is the $m$-th power of an integer.
    *   Example: $\sqrt[3]{36}$ cannot be simplified to an integer, so it is Irrational.

## ❓ **7. Important Exam Concepts & Questions**

### **The Inequality Rule ($3^N$ vs $N^3$)**
For the inequality **$3^N > N^3$**:
*   If $N=1$: $3^1 > 1^3$ (3 > 1) ✅ True
*   If $N=2$: $3^2 > 2^3$ (9 > 8) ✅ True
*   If $N=3$: $3^3 > 3^3$ (27 > 27) ❌ False
*   If $N=4$: $3^4 > 4^3$ (81 > 64) ✅ True
*   **Conclusion:** This holds true for all natural numbers **except N = 3**.

### **Rational Division Rule**
If a positive integer is divided by another positive integer ($p/q$), the result is **always a Rational Number**.
*   Example: $3/7$, $5/2$ (2.5), $6/2$ (3). All are rational.

### **Power Operations with Signs**
If $x$ is a positive even integer (e.g., 2) and $y$ is a negative odd integer (e.g., -1):
*   $x^y = 2^{-1} = \frac{1}{2}$
*   **Result:** This forms a **Rational Number**.

### **Pi ($\pi$) Clarification**
*   **$\pi$** is an **Irrational Number** (Non-terminating, non-recurring).
*   **$22/7$** is a **Rational Number** ($p/q$ form).
*   $3.14$ is a **Rational Number** (Terminating decimal).

### **Square of a Prime Number**
The square of a prime number ($p^2$) has exactly three factors: 1, $p$, and $p^2$. Therefore, it is always a **Composite Number**.
